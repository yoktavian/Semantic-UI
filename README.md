<p>I'll using my WWWH pattern on this topic

<li> When
<li> Where
<li> How

Let's start with <b>What.</b>

# What
If you go to an official website of [semantic-ui](https://semantic-ui.com/) you will found the explanation on there. <br><br>
`Semantic is a development framework that helps create beautiful, responsive layouts using human-friendly HTML.` <br><br>
You should notice on the `development framework`, `layout` and `HTML`. These keys are already define what actually `semantic-ui` is.

# How
There is some options that you can to follow. On this stage, i wanna minimize the different step if we are using diferrent OS (Windows, Mac, etc) for example my laptop with yours or somebody else who read this docs. Ok, let's start the experiment.

First you need to install node JS, please going to this an official website and download node JS installer. [Click here to Download!](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). 

I'll wating for you, so take your time and take your coffee when downloading the file. I recommend you to dowload `LTS (recommended for most user)` version instead of `current (latest)`. Why? because `LTS` version should be more stable than `current` version. But in the other hand if you wanna try the latest version it should be fine, just try it.

When download is completed and the installer is ready just open the file and install it.
