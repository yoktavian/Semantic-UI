# Semantic-UI

Hello! before i am going to give an explanation about semantic-ui i wanna you to know that i wrote this docs for study purpose. So if i have some step or anything else that i missing on it, i am so sorry. Feel free to reach out of me at yoktavian17@gmail.com.

I will start my explanation and give you some tutorial step by step how to using semantic-ui.

<b>Outlines :</b>
<p>I'll using my WWWH pattern on this topic
<li> What
<li> When
<li> Where
<li> How

Let's start with <b>What.</b>

# What
If you go to an official website of [semantic-ui](https://semantic-ui.com/) you will found the explanation on there. <br><br>
`Semantic is a development framework that helps create beautiful, responsive layouts using human-friendly HTML.` <br><br>
You should notice on the `development framework`, `layout` and `HTML`. These keys are already define what actually `semantic-ui` is.

# How
There is some options that you can to follow. On this stage, i wanna minimize the different step if we are using diferrent OS (Windows, Mac, etc) for example my laptop with yours or somebody else who read this docs. Ok, let's start the experiment.

<li> <b>Node JS </b>

First you need to install node JS, please going to this an official website and download node JS installer. [Click here to Download!](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). 

I'll wating for you, so take your time and take your coffee when downloading the file. I recommend you to dowload `LTS (recommended for most user)` version instead of `current (latest)`. Why? because `LTS` version should be more stable than `current` version. But in the other hand if you wanna try the latest version it should be fine, just try it.

When download is completed and the installer is ready just open the file and install it.

Hit install button

And here we go, node JS is already installed on your computer! Close it and leave it. The final step is to double check that node JS is installed on your computer, please open new terminal (if you already open it before installation complete, close the terminal first then reopen it) then type:

`npm --version`

If you see the version like `6.14.5` (version that i used when writting this docs) in your terminal it means you're on the right track. 
`11` 
<li> <b> Gulp </b> 

Gulp is toolkit to automate & enchance workflow. You can read more at 
[here](https://gulpjs.com/). 

Semantic UI uses gulp to provide command line tools for building themed version of library and depend on what components you need for the UI. Let's started to installing gulp.

We need to installing gulp using node JS that been installed before. Open your terminal first, then type: 

`npm install -g gulp`
